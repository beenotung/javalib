Genetic Algorithm

### phase 1
crossover:
 - don't kill parent
 - bad gene crossover with good gene (then replace bad gene)
mutation:
 - simple random
### phase 2
crossover:
 - flag indicate kill parent or not
 - flag to only allow good gene to crossover (replace bad gene)
### phase 3
save / load from file
### phase 4
add migration feature
 - exchange the gene with peer (socket)
### phase 5
mutation:
 - related to diversity
n_pop:
 - related to diversity & system resource
