# javalib
lib in pure java

similar to jslib, myutils
but this repo contains only java code
minimal dependency on external library, even the standard library (so that hopefully less painful when need to work on jdk7)

## short term goal
some of the feature are implemented in scala, but what if you are not allowed to use scala (e.g. in assignment)

this library is very compact, (for quick reimplement during competition when e-resources is not allowed to bring in)


## long term goal
maybe it's more worth in invest on scalalib
